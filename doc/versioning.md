Versioning
============================================
All public releases do have a codename, based on animals, in format `(IUCN vulnerability status) (English name for species)`.

## Creating codename

 1. Pick an animal
 2. Check its IUCN vulnerability status
 3. ...
 4. Profit!

## Initial releases
First versions, released in Autumn 2013, were numbered as `1.x` and `2.x`.

 - 0.0 Unknown Umbrella Bird: default version for unconfigured build
 - 1.0 Endangered Saimaa ringed seal: first public release, August 2013
 - 2.0 Least Concern Daubenton's Bat: misc improvements, never officially released


## Version numbering (year.month.day.revision)
Since December 2013, new versioning scheme was introduced. Follows Ubuntu pattern: `(year - 2000).(month)`. See file `scripts/version.helper` for technical details. Version changes when new features are added.

 - 13.12 Extinct Western Black Rhinoceros
 - ??.?? no-name-yet

Guidelines to distinguish Non-commercial and Commercial Use
You may only use the GeoGebra Software and Materials under the terms of a relevant licence agreement. The licence agreement which applies to you depends on your use of the Software and the Materials, which can be summarised as follows:

You are free to copy, distribute and transmit GeoGebra for non-commercial purposes. Non-commercial use is subject to the terms of our GeoGebra Non-Commercial License Agreement.
Any use of GeoGebra for a commercial purpose is subject to the licence terms set out in our Collaboration and License Agreement Template (pdf). If you intend to use GeoGebra for a commercial purpose, please contact  office@geogebra.org to arrange a Collaboration Agreement with us.
Whether a particular use of the GeoGebra Materials is "non-commercial" depends on the use, not the user, and to assist we have set out the notes below:

Non-commercial Use. We anticipate that non-commercial use will primarily involve students and teachers who may wish to use GeoGebra at home and in school for the purposes of their school or academic study and teaching, without intending to seek any commercial advantage or financial gain.
Commercial Use. We anticipate that commercial use will primarily involve publishers, online schools and non-profit organizations who wish to use GeoGebra to support activities that are intended toward securing a commercial advantage or the generation of revenue or monetary compensation.
Examples of commercial use might include:

use of GeoGebra (or any related materials or resources) to generate or develop educational materials or resources which will be sold in exchange for a fee or (if given away for free) which are used to gain a commercial advantage for the user;
the provision of training, support or editorial services that use or reference GeoGebra (or any related materials or resources) in exchange for a fee;
use of GeoGebra (or any related materials or resources) within a textbook or journal, whether or not the book or journal is distributed for a fee;
use of GeoGebra (or any related materials or resources) as part of a conference where delegates are charged to attend and/or purchase conference materials (which include GeoGebra or any related materials or resources); and
use of GeoGebra (or any related materials or resources) to assist in securing advertising or sponsorship type revenues.
These guidelines were last updated in April 2013.

digabi-firewall
===================

Configuration for digabi-firewall.

Compile using `digabi firewall compile`.

Configuration: these configuration files will create new 
/etc/iptables.rules, which will be enabled at boot time. If 
configuration file has execution bit (+x), compilation script will run 
it & add its output, instead of the file itself.
